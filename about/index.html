<h1>About Carbon & Place</h1>

<p>Carbon & Place is a family of tools developed as part of the <a href="https://www.edrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Demand Research Centre</a>.</p>

<h2>A new name, the same mission</h2>

<p>In 2020, with the support of the <a href="https://www.creds.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions</a> (CREDS), we launched the Place-Based Carbon Calculator, the PBCC. The tool was intended to help communities, planners, and policymakers understand how carbon footprints vary from place to place and what can be done to reduce them. The PBBC was a big success, widely used by people across England, and received several updates. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end and in 2023 CREDS reached the end of its funding period and closed down. Fortunately, the newly established Energy Demand Research Centre (EDRC) agreed to take on and expand the PBCC for the next five years. The PBCC became part of the <a href="https://www.edrc.ac.uk/research/place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDRC Place Theme</a>, and in 2024 this website was relaunched as Carbon & Place.</p> 

<p>The rebrand was more than cosmetic, the PBCC became one of many tools offered by Carbon & Place. This allows us to go into more detail about specific topics, such as transport or retrofits, while also expanding and improving upon the original PBCC. Carbon & Place will be updated regularly with new features and improvements.</p>

<h2>Free for everyone forever</h2>

<p>The tools on Carbon & Place are developed as Open-Source Software and, as much as possible, use Open Data. All of the tools are free to use, and most of the data is free to download. We believe it is important that taxpayer-funded research is transparent and accessible, so we will provide as much detail as possible about data and methods. In many places the tools have help popups (look for the blue ?) that provide more information, or you can view all the documentation in the manual.</p>

<p>You can find all our <a href="https://github.com/PlaceBasedCarbonCalculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code on GitHub</a>, and most of our outputs are free to <a href="/data">download</a>.</p>

<p>In a limited number of cases, the licensing terms of the data we use mean we cannot publish datasets in full. In these cases, we provide details on accessing the original data.</p>

<h2>How do you use Carbon & Place?</h2>
<p>Most of the tools area interactive maps of the UK. You can pan and zoom around the country and change the data shown on the map using the menu bar on the right of the screen. Clicking on any of the <abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr>s shown on the map will bring up a local report card. The report card contains more information on how the carbon footprints were calculated, as well as comparisons with other areas.
The report card also gives useful information about contributing factors such as how well insulated homes are or how far the average person drives per year.</p>

<h2>Can I download the data and use it in my own projects?</h2>
<p>Carbon & Place is an open source project and you can use the code and data subject to their respective licences. This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Affero General Public License v3.0</a>. For data download and license rules see the <a href="/data">data page</a>.</p>

<h2>Who created Carbon & Place and how was it funded?</h2>

<p>Carbon & Place was produced with funding from UK Research and Innovation, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and the Economic and Social Research Council through the <a href="https://www.edrc.ac.uk/about/our-funders-and-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Demand Research Centre</a>, grant reference number EP/Y010078/1</p>

<p>The original PBCC was produced with funding from UK Research and Innovation through the <a href="https://www.creds.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions</a>, grant reference number EP/R 035288/1</p>

<p>The PBCC estimates the average carbon footprint per person for each <abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> in England. <abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr>s are small statistical areas with a population of about 1,500 - 3,000. The tool takes a consumption based approach to carbon footprints, this means that the emissions are counted by the consumer of a good or service not the producer. For example if you by a new phone made in China, the emissions from making that phone will be produced in China, but will count towards your carbon footprint in England as you are the consumer.</p>

<h2>How are the carbon footprints calculated?</h2>
<p>To calculate an exact carbon footprint requires a lot of detailed information on individual behaviours and consumption patterns. Unfortunately, this kind of data does not exist for everybody in England. Instead, this tool draws on the best available data and research for each part of our carbon footprint. When we have detailed local data, we use it, such as for gas and electricity consumption. But for other types of consumption, such as food, we rely on surveys and modelling to fill in the gaps. Together these methods give an overview of the total carbon footprint for an <abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr>. We then divided the total footprint by the number of people living in the <abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> to get an average carbon footprint per person. We use this measure as it easy to understand and compare across different areas. But it is important to remember that within an <abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr> there may be significant variation from person to person.</p>
