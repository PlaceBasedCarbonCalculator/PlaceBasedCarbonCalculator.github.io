### Introduction
It is hard to discuss issues around place without eventually coming to the topic of land ownership. Land owners through a combination of action and inaction sculpted the country into what it is today, ultimately they decide where the homes and jobs are, what it farmland and where is left for nature. Despite their enormous power, landownership is no democratically allocated, a small elite own a large proportion of the land in the UK, and data about who owns what is often hard to come by.

The Land Ownership Explorer is intended to cast a little light onto the issue of land ownership by providing a more accessible form of official Land Registry datasets.
